        Q1 "We are interested in retrieving only the students' names; all the names should be in caps.
           ['JOHN', 'BABA', 'YAGA', 'WICK']"
        Ans -> let names=studentRecords.map(val=>val.name.toUpperCase());
            console.log(names)
            output //<q1></q1>
            toUpperCase will convert the the all characters in uppercase map is used to create new array 

        Q2 "Suppose we have the same dataset as above but this time we want to get the details of students who scored more than 50 marks.
        [{name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 },{name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks: 75 }]"
        Ans -> let val=studentRecords.filter(val=>val.marks>50);
        console.log(val)
        output //<q2>
        [{
            "name": "John",
            "id": 123,
            "marks": 98
        },
        {
            "name": "yaga",
            "id": 200,
            "marks": 60
        },
        {
            "name": "Wick",
            "id": 115,
            "marks": 75
        }]
        </q2>
        filter is used to filter the data accourding to the given condition


        Q3 Retrieve the details of students who scored more than 50 marks and have IDs greater than 120.
        Ans -> let val=studentRecords.filter(val=>val.marks>50&& val.id>120 );
        console.log(val)
        output // <q3>[
            {
                "name": "John",
                "id": 123,
                "marks": 98
            }
        ]</q3>
        filter is used to filter the data accourding to the given condition

        Q4 Consider the same scenario we have discussed above, but this time we would like to know the sum total of the marks of the students.
        Ans ->let val=studentRecords.reduce((acc, val)=>acc+val.marks,0);
        console.log(val)
        output // <q4></q4>
        every value val.marks is stored in acc and its returned

        Q5 This time we want to get only the names of the students who scored more than 50 marks from the same dataset used above.
        let val=studentRecords.reduce((acc,iniVal)=>{if(iniVal.marks>50){
            acc.push(iniVal.name);
        }return acc;
        },[]); 
        console.log(val)
        // output ['John', 'Wick']

        reduce will search for the marks greater then 50 and push the name into the accumulator array 

        Q6 This time we are required to print the sum of marks of the students with id > 120.
        let val1 =studentRecords.reduce((acc,iniVal)=>{iniVal.id>120 && (acc+=iniVal.marks); return acc;},0)
        console.log(val1)
        
        output //143
        accumulator will check student id is greater than 120 and add all the students marks

        Q7 This time we are required to print the total marks of the students with marks greater than 50 after a grace of 15 marks has been added to those students who scored less than 50.
        let val2 =studentRecords.reduce((acc,iniVal)=>{
            if(iniVal.marks<50){
                iniVal.marks=iniVal.marks+15;
            }
            if(iniVal.marks>50){
                acc+=iniVal.marks;
            }
            return acc;
        },0)
        output //<a id="q7"></a>
        first if statement will change all values less than 50 by adding them 15
        and second if will check the value is greater than  50 and it in accumulator and return sum value  

        Q8 Create 6 objects , each object will have name, class, roll no as properties. Store these objects in an array of objects. 

        function Student(name,className,rollno){
            this.name=name;
            this.className=className;
            this.rollno=rollno
        }
        let student1 = new Student('rohan', '10th', 101);
        let student2 = new Student('shubham', '9th', 102);
        let student3 = new Student('aniket', '11th', 103);
        let student4 = new Student('rohit', '12th', 104);
        let student5 = new Student('nikhil', '8th', 105);
        let student6 = new Student('anup', '10th', 106);
        
        let studentArr=[student1,student2,student3,student4,student5,student6];
        console.log(studentArr)

        output // [
        {
            "name": "rohan",
            "className": "10th",
            "rollno": 101
        },
        {
            "name": "shubham",
            "className": "9th",
            "rollno": 102
        },
        {
            "name": "aniket",
            "className": "11th",
            "rollno": 103
        },
        {
            "name": "rohit",
            "className": "12th",
            "rollno": 104
        },
        {
            "name": "nikhil",
            "className": "8th",
            "rollno": 105
        },
        {
            "name": "anup",
            "className": "10th",
            "rollno": 106
        }
    ]

    function constructor will be able to assign the value to variable and with the help of new keyword new object is created
